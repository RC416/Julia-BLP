#= blp data contains the following variables

# Identifying Variables
firmid: id number of a car manufacturer. 26 unique firms.
cdid: year since 1970, each year treated as new market. 20 years from 1970-1990.
id: unique vehicle id number. 2217 unique products. 

# Product Characteristics
const: value 1 for every observation
hpwt: horsepower to weight ratio
air: presence of airbags (binary)
mpg: miles per gallon
space: amount of space in the car
price: price of the car

# Market Shares
share: market share of given product in given year (cdid)
outshr: fraction of consumers that did not buy any car that year (same for all cars in a given year)

# Question 1a solution. 

# Estimate demand coefficients in logit model with normal OLS.

# construct the BLP instruments

id = Vector(blp_data[!,"id"])
cdid = Vector(blp_data[!,"cdid"])
firmid = Vector(blp_data[!,"firmid"])

#= Two sets of instruments
1. Characteristics of other products from the same company in the same market.
Logic: the characteristics of other products affect the price of a 
given product but not its demand. Alternatively, firms decide product characteristics X 
before observing demand shocks ξ. 
2. Characteristics of other products from different companies in the same market.
Logic: the characteristics of competing products affects the price of a
given product but not its demand. Alternatively, other firms decide their product
characteristics X without observing the demand shock for the given product ξ.
