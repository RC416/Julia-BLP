# Julia-BLP
 Implementing the BLP method using Julia to illustrate the approach used in the seminal BLP paper.
 This is not a package or otherwise suitable for application on other datasets.
 This was an extension of course work; code is focused on clarity rather than speed, although some optimizaiton was done to achieve reasonable compute times.
