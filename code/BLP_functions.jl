#= Demand Objective Function -----------------------------------------------------------
Performs the key steps for BLP demand estimation

Key steps:
1. given θ₂, solve for δ using contraction mapping
2. using δ, calculate ξⱼ = δ - xⱼθ₁
3. set up GMM moments: E[Z*ξ(θ)] = G(θ) = 0 and construct GMM function Q(θ) = G(θ)'*W*G(θ)
4. return GMM function value

Step 1. requires calculating predicted market share given δ. 
This is done with the second function here, σ().

Inputs:

θ₂: 5x1 vector of σᵛ coefficients (for all variables except space). Space random coefficient not estimated to aid estimation. 
X:  2217x6 matrix of observables (including price)
s:  2217x1 vector of product market shares
Z:  2217x15 vector of BLP instruments
v:  50x5 vector of random draws from joint normal mean 0 variance 1. 
    One random draw per each of the 5 θ₂ coefficents per person.
market_id: 2217x1 vector of market id for each product/observation (cdid, market = years in this dataset)

Does not use θ₁ as an input. Rather, backs out θ₁ from θ₂ in the step 2.
This allows for optimization over only the θ₂ coefficients (5) without including θ₁ (6 others).

δ = zeros(size(s))

# 1. Contraction mapping to find δ
# set up contraction mapping for δ.
# use first output of σ() which is the predicted share. second output is the indivudal shares. 
Φ(δ) = δ + log.(s) - log.(σ(δ,θ₂,X,v,market_id)[1])

end

# get the shares for each individual to use for calculating the gradient. 
# vector of 2217 products x 50 individuals
𝒯 = σ(δ,θ₂,X,v,market_id)[2]

# back out the θ₁ value implied by delta. Note "space" not used in X. Lines 22-25 of GMM object in Matlab code.
# we have δ = Xθ₁' 
# without instruments: θ₁ = (X'X)⁻¹X'δ                    (OLS)
# with instruments: ̂X = Z (Z'Z)⁻¹Z'X   and θ₁ = (̂X'̂X)⁻¹̂Xδ   (2SLS)
# sub in for 2SLS: θ₁ = (̂X'̂X)⁻¹̂Xδ = ([(Z'Z)⁻¹Z'X]'[(Z'Z)⁻¹Z'X])⁻¹[(Z'Z)⁻¹Z'X]*δ
# θ₁ = inv((Z*inv(Z'Z)*Z'X)'*(Z*inv(Z'Z)*Z'X))*(Z*inv(Z'Z)*Z'X)'*δ
# which reduces to the expression:
θ₁ = inv((X'Z)*inv(Z'Z)*(X'Z)') * (X'Z)*inv(Z'Z)*Z'δ


# 2. using δ, calculate unobserved demand ξⱼ(θ) = δ-xⱼβ for all markets
ξ = δ - X*θ₁


# 3. construct GMM objective function
# recall GMM momement condition: E[h(Z)ξ(θ)] = 0
# where h(Z) = Z' (vector of instruments)
#       ξ(θ) = δⱼ(θ) - xⱼβ
# GMM objective fuction:
# Q(θ) = G(θ)'*W*G(θ)

# weighting matrix. 
W = inv(Z'Z) # Z'Z is optimal if ξ(θ) term is i.i.d. (normally the error term)
# GMM objective function value
Q = (Z'ξ)' * W * (Z'ξ)

# 4. return objective function value and other useful values.
return Q, θ₁, ξ, 𝒯
end





#= Market Share Estimation Function -----------------------------------------------------------
Estimates the market share of each product given delta and θ₂.
Used to solve the contraction mapping of the objective function to find the correct δ.

Market share of product j in a given market is: 
σⱼ = ∫exp(pⱼα + Xβ + pⱼvᵢₖₚσᵛₚ + Σₖ xⱼₖvᵢₖσᵛₖ) / 1 + Σₖ exp(pₖα + Xβ + pₖvᵢₖₚσᵛₚ + Σₖ xⱼₖvᵢₖσᵛₖ) * f(νᵢ)dνᵢ
where δ = pⱼα + Xβ   and   μ = pⱼvᵢₖₚσᵛₚ + Σₖ xⱼₖvᵢₖσᵛₖ = X*(v*θ₂')'
therefore: σⱼ = ∫exp(δⱼ + μⱼᵢ) / 1 + Σₖ exp(δₖ + μₖᵢ) * f(νᵢ)dνᵢ

Key steps:
1. Calculate μⱼᵢ for each individual for each product within each market (2217x50)
2. Using given δ and μ, calculate numerator of σⱼ: exp(δⱼ + μⱼᵢ)
3. Calculate the sum term in the denominator. Build a matrix 2217x50 of
demonominator terms for each individual within a given market.
4. Use divide numerator from 2. by denominator from 3. to get individual shares
for each product across the 50 individuals.
5. Calculate the mean share across the 50 individuals (equivalent to Monty Carlo integration).

Returns vector of predicted market shares for every product in the market. 

Considerably faster than the explicit version of the function since most calculations
    are done on vectors/matrices (3.2 ms versus 112 ms).

Inputs:
δ:  nx1 vector. represents xβ + ξ. One for each product in given market
θ₂: 5x1 vector of σᵛ coefficients. One for each x variable
X:  nx5 matrix of observables for all n products in a market. Drops random coefficient for "space" to aid estimation.
v:  50x5 vector of random draws from joint normal mean 0 variance 1. 
    One random draw per each of the 5 θ₂ coefficents per person.
market_id: 2217x1 vector of market id for each product/observation (cdid, market = years in this dataset)

    # assign to each row for given individual in given market
    ∑ₖexp[market_id.==market,:] = repeat(market_denominator, sum(market_id.==market))
end

# average across individuals (Monty Carlo integration)
