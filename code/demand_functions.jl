#= Demand Objective Function -----------------------------------------------------------
Performs the key steps for BLP demand estimation

Key steps:
1. given Œ∏‚ÇÇ, solve for Œ¥ using contraction mapping
2. using Œ¥, calculate Œæ‚±º = Œ¥ - x‚±ºŒ∏‚ÇÅ
3. set up GMM moments: E[Z*Œæ(Œ∏)] = G(Œ∏) = 0 and construct GMM function Q(Œ∏) = G(Œ∏)'*W*G(Œ∏)
4. return GMM function value

Step 1. requires calculating predicted market share given Œ¥. 
This is done with the second function here, œÉ().

Inputs:

Œ∏‚ÇÇ: 5x1 vector of œÉ·µõ coefficients (for all variables except space). Space random coefficient not estimated to aid estimation. 
X:  2217x6 matrix of observables (including price)
s:  2217x1 vector of product market shares
Z:  2217x15 vector of BLP instruments
v:  50x5 vector of random draws from joint normal mean 0 variance 1. 
    One random draw per each of the 5 Œ∏‚ÇÇ coefficents per person.
market_id: 2217x1 vector of market id for each product/observation (cdid, market = years in this dataset)

Does not use Œ∏‚ÇÅ as an input. Rather, backs out Œ∏‚ÇÅ from Œ∏‚ÇÇ in the step 2.
This allows for optimization over only the Œ∏‚ÇÇ coefficients (5) without including Œ∏‚ÇÅ (6 others).
=#

function demand_objective_function(Œ∏‚ÇÇ,X,s,Z,v,market_id)

# initialze Œ¥ 
Œ¥ = zeros(size(s))

# 1. Contraction mapping to find Œ¥
# set up contraction mapping for Œ¥.
# use first output of œÉ() which is the predicted share. second output is the indivudal shares. 
Œ¶(Œ¥) = Œ¥ + log.(s) - log.(œÉ(Œ¥,Œ∏‚ÇÇ,X,v,market_id)[1])

# contraction mapping parameters
tolerance = 1e-6                      # Matlab code uses 1e-6 or 1e-9
largest_dif = Inf                     # track difference from first value. initialze at a value above tolerance
max_iterations = 1000                 # reasonable limit 
counter = 0                           # track iterations 

while (largest_dif > tolerance)
    # recalculate delta
    Œ¥ = Œ¶(Œ¥)
    # check if all estimates (elements) are within tolerance
    largest_dif = maximum(abs.( Œ¥ - Œ¶(Œ¥) ))
    # check if max iterations is exceeded
    counter += 1
    if counter == max_iterations
        break
    end
end

# get the shares for each individual to use for calculating the gradient. 
# vector of 2217 products x 50 individuals
ùíØ = œÉ(Œ¥,Œ∏‚ÇÇ,X,v,market_id)[2]

# back out the Œ∏‚ÇÅ value implied by delta. Note "space" not used in X. Lines 22-25 of GMM object in Matlab code.
# we have Œ¥ = XŒ∏‚ÇÅ' 
# without instruments: Œ∏‚ÇÅ = (X'X)‚Åª¬πX'Œ¥                    (OLS)
# with instruments: ÃÇX = Z (Z'Z)‚Åª¬πZ'X   and Œ∏‚ÇÅ = (ÃÇX'ÃÇX)‚Åª¬πÃÇXŒ¥   (2SLS)
# sub in for 2SLS: Œ∏‚ÇÅ = (ÃÇX'ÃÇX)‚Åª¬πÃÇXŒ¥ = ([(Z'Z)‚Åª¬πZ'X]'[(Z'Z)‚Åª¬πZ'X])‚Åª¬π[(Z'Z)‚Åª¬πZ'X]*Œ¥
# Œ∏‚ÇÅ = inv((Z*inv(Z'Z)*Z'X)'*(Z*inv(Z'Z)*Z'X))*(Z*inv(Z'Z)*Z'X)'*Œ¥
# which reduces to the expression:
Œ∏‚ÇÅ = inv((X'Z)*inv(Z'Z)*(X'Z)') * (X'Z)*inv(Z'Z)*Z'Œ¥


# 2. using Œ¥, calculate unobserved demand Œæ‚±º(Œ∏) = Œ¥-x‚±ºŒ≤ for all markets
Œæ = Œ¥ - X*Œ∏‚ÇÅ


# 3. construct GMM objective function
# recall GMM momement condition: E[h(Z)Œæ(Œ∏)] = 0
# where h(Z) = Z' (vector of instruments)
#       Œæ(Œ∏) = Œ¥‚±º(Œ∏) - x‚±ºŒ≤
# GMM objective fuction:
# Q(Œ∏) = G(Œ∏)'*W*G(Œ∏)

# weighting matrix. 
W = inv(Z'Z) # Z'Z is optimal if Œæ(Œ∏) term is i.i.d. (normally the error term)
# GMM objective function value
Q = (Z'Œæ)' * W * (Z'Œæ)

# 4. return objective function value and other useful values.
return Q, Œ∏‚ÇÅ, Œæ, ùíØ
end





#= Market Share Estimation Function -----------------------------------------------------------
Estimates the market share of each product given delta and Œ∏‚ÇÇ.
Used to solve the contraction mapping of the objective function to find the correct Œ¥.

Market share of product j in a given market is: 
œÉ‚±º = ‚à´exp(p‚±ºŒ± + XŒ≤ + p‚±ºv·µ¢‚Çñ‚ÇöœÉ·µõ‚Çö + Œ£‚Çñ x‚±º‚Çñv·µ¢‚ÇñœÉ·µõ‚Çñ) / 1 + Œ£‚Çñ exp(p‚ÇñŒ± + XŒ≤ + p‚Çñv·µ¢‚Çñ‚ÇöœÉ·µõ‚Çö + Œ£‚Çñ x‚±º‚Çñv·µ¢‚ÇñœÉ·µõ‚Çñ) * f(ŒΩ·µ¢)dŒΩ·µ¢
where Œ¥ = p‚±ºŒ± + XŒ≤   and   Œº = p‚±ºv·µ¢‚Çñ‚ÇöœÉ·µõ‚Çö + Œ£‚Çñ x‚±º‚Çñv·µ¢‚ÇñœÉ·µõ‚Çñ = X*(v*Œ∏‚ÇÇ')'
therefore: œÉ‚±º = ‚à´exp(Œ¥‚±º + Œº‚±º·µ¢) / 1 + Œ£‚Çñ exp(Œ¥‚Çñ + Œº‚Çñ·µ¢) * f(ŒΩ·µ¢)dŒΩ·µ¢

Key steps:
1. Calculate Œº‚±º·µ¢ for each individual for each product within each market (2217x50)
2. Using given Œ¥ and Œº, calculate numerator of œÉ‚±º: exp(Œ¥‚±º + Œº‚±º·µ¢)
3. Calculate the sum term in the denominator. Build a matrix 2217x50 of
demonominator terms for each individual within a given market.
4. Divide numerator from 2. by denominator from 3. to get individual shares
for each product across the 50 individuals.
5. Calculate the mean share across the 50 individuals (equivalent to Monty Carlo integration).

Returns vector of predicted market shares for every product in the market. 

Considerably faster than the explicit version of the function since most calculations
    are done on vectors/matrices (3.2 ms versus 112 ms).

Inputs:
Œ¥:  nx1 vector. represents xŒ≤ + Œæ. One for each product in given market
Œ∏‚ÇÇ: 5x1 vector of œÉ·µõ coefficients. One for each x variable
X:  nx5 matrix of observables for all n products in a market. Drops random coefficient for "space" to aid estimation.
v:  50x5 vector of random draws from joint normal mean 0 variance 1. 
    One random draw per each of the 5 Œ∏‚ÇÇ coefficents per person.
market_id: 2217x1 vector of market id for each product/observation (cdid, market = years in this dataset)
=#

function œÉ(Œ¥, Œ∏‚ÇÇ, X, v, market_id)

# get number of individuals and products
n_individuals = size(v,2)
n_products = size(X,1)

# get delta for each individual (identical): 2217x50
Œ¥ = repeat(Œ¥,1,n_individuals) # repeats Œ¥ for each of the 50 individuals

# calculate Œº‚±º·µ¢ for each product for each individual: 2217x50
Œº = zeros(n_products, n_individuals)
for market in unique(market_id)
    # Œº‚±º·µ¢ = ‚àë‚Çñ x‚±º‚Çñ * v‚Çñ·µ¢ * œÉ‚Çñ   where œÉ‚Çñ is one of the Œ∏‚ÇÇ coefficients  
    #Œº[market_id.==market,:] = X[market_id.==market,Not(6)] * (v[:,:] .* Œ∏‚ÇÇ')' 
    Œº[market_id.==market,:] = X[market_id.==market,Not(6)] * (v[market,:,:] .* Œ∏‚ÇÇ')' 
end

# the numerator is easily calculated as: exp(Œ¥+Œº)

# for the denominator: calculate the denominator term for each individual in each market: 2217x50
‚àë‚Çñexp = zeros(size(Œº))
# for each market
for market in unique(market_id)
    # get the sequence of denominator terms for each individual
    denom_sequence = exp.(Œ¥[market_id.==market,:] + Œº[market_id.==market,:])
    # sum over all products in market for each individual
    market_denominator = sum(denom_sequence, dims=1)
    # assign to each row for given individual in given market
    ‚àë‚Çñexp[market_id.==market,:] = repeat(market_denominator, sum(market_id.==market))
end

# calculate market share for each product for each individual (2217 products x 50 individuals)
ùíØ = exp.(Œ¥+Œº) ./ (1 .+ ‚àë‚Çñexp)
# average across individuals (Monty Carlo integration)
œÉ = mean(ùíØ, dims=2)[:]   # semicolon to make 2217x1 and get rid of hidden second dimension  

# return vector of estimated market shares: 2217x1
return œÉ, ùíØ
